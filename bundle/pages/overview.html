<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Combustion systems play a vital role in transportation, energy production, and residential heating. Nonetheless, current combustion systems heavily rely on fossil fuels, which burning process is now acknowledged for being a source of greenhouse gases and consequently responsible for climate change [1 IPCC].
While dismantling completely our reliance on combustion is unfeasible for the so-called 'Hard to abate industries' [2 cerca su paper di parente], existing combustion processes can significantly reduce their CO2 emissions leveraging sustainable fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, and methane [3 IDK what to cite]. A correct understanding of the physics of these fuels can help in the design of reliable and efficient systems that burn the aforementioned fuels.One of the challenges in modeling this physical phenomena is the complex interaction between turbulence and chemistry in industrial systems.

Large eddy simulations (LES) stand as a powerful computational approach for studying turbulent combustion. LES directly resolves the large, energy-containing motions in the flow and filter the smaller scales. Advances in high-performance computing and efficient algorithms have made this method increasingly accessible for practical use, but modeling the so-called sub-filter phenomena that arise at the unresolved smaller scales is a very challenging task. Part of the current and past efforts from the scientific community developed physics based methods---such as transport equations---to link sub-filter quantities to the resolved field.

Machine learning (ML) is an interesting tool in improving turbulent combustion closure models for LES. Typical ML algorithms, such as Neural Networks, can analyze large datasets from direct numerical simulations (DNS), which provide highly accurate representations of turbulence and chemistry interactions. By learning patterns from this data, ML helps build models that better capture the complex interactions in combustion.
